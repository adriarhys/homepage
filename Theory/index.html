    <div class="container">
    <p>A menu uses words and images to symbolize food and drinks, each item on the menu represents a different food or drink and what it contains.  This provides people a way to decide what they would like without having to try or see the food or drink.  It also lets people view the cost of each item before purchasing.  Menus often have categories to group similar items together like appetizers and entrees making it easier to navigate. They can help people make informed choices and find items within a set budget. A menu design can also help people understand what kind of establishment they are in, as a fine dining menu would differ from a deli menu design.  A menu representation is mostly accurate, sometimes a menu will have items on it that a restaurant does not have leading to misinformation.  However, a menu is still mostly successful in its representation of culinary offerings.</p>

    <div class="container">
    <p> A traffic light has three colors that all represent an action.  Red to stop, green to go, and yellow to slow down or prepare to stop. All of these colors are universally understood to mean these instructions even though they don’t have meanings on their own.  These instructions are recognized almost everywhere which helps with traffic safety and speed.  Ordering of the lights also helps people anticipate what comes next in the sequence.  Traffic lights can offer a complex set of instructions through a simple design.  They are very effective in their representations and don't often lead to misleading information.  I would say they are successful in the representation of traffic instructions.</p>

    <div class="container">
    <p>Nutritional facts show data on the nutrients contained in packaged food. This helps people gauge the nutritional value of prepackaged food and can compare it to other options.  They typically have a standardized format and include a serving size for reference.  This can help people make informed decisions about what they are eating.  They have to be compliant with food labeling regulations to make sure you know what you are consuming.  They visually use charts and include the recommended daily amount or percentage of each item.  Nutritional facts help translate complex dietary information into easily understandable information. They are very accurate to what they represent due to food laws and don’t contain misleading information making them very successful in their representations.</p>

    <summary>classification of sign types</summary>
    <ul>
    <img  src="pexels-cax0000-3636100.jpg" alt="Menu">
    <div class="container">
    <p>A menu can be classified as an icon.  An icon is a sign that is seen as imitating or representing an object and generally looks, feels or smells similar to what it’s representing. A menu most often has images of the food or beverage and always has descriptions.  These directly reflect what a customer would be receiving if ordered.

    <img  src="pexels-wdnet-190448.jpg" alt="traffic light">
    <div class="container">
    <p> A traffic light can be classified as a symbol.  A symbol is a sign that represents something through an agreed upon meaning. A traffic light uses green, yellow, and red, to signify different instructions to drivers.  Even though none of these colors have a direct meaning on their own, their ordering in the light as well as their colors let drivers know when to go, slow down, or stop.  People have agreed that each light has these meanings to help keep traffic flowing and safe.

    <div class="container">
    <p>Nutritional facts can be classified as an icon.  An icon is a sign that represents something directly through sight, touch or smell.  Nutritional facts contain lots of visual charts, tables, and percentages of the nutritional content of the food.  This can help people visually see how much of something is in the food they are eating.</p>

    <summary>natural imitations / productive copy / simulacrum</summary>
    <ul>
    <img  src="pexels-cax0000-3636100.jpg" alt="Menu">
    <div class="container">
    <p>A menu could be fully removed from reality and considered a simulacrum because it represents an experience within food and dining that goes further than what's just listed.  A menu represents an experience by suggesting what will be offered but does not contain the actual food or beverage. This works with Baudrillard's first step of removal reflection as the menu reflects what may be provided.   A menu can then mask what it contains by highlighting certain options above others or providing more appetizing descriptions creating a more idealized version that may distort a person's choice. For the third step of absence, a menu could be missing items that are offered or provide false information such as “world’s best” in descriptions of food or even have false sales or prices. This calls into question if any of the menu is even true or if certain items even exist.  In the final stage, we could look at a menu of a restaurant that doesn’t exist anymore so it is impossible to order anything.  Or we could look at a dish on a menu so far modified and changed for aesthetic purposes that it is nothing like what the customer is expecting.

    <img  src="pexels-wdnet-190448.jpg" alt="traffic light">
    <div class="container">
    <p> A traffic light can be partly removed from reality using Baudrillard’s steps of removal.  It represents safety and reflects assigned meanings with the colored lights that expand past their original purpose.  A traffic light could mask its true meaning if there is a power outage and it no longer works, or if a light is programmed incorrectly somehow and displays the wrong lights at the wrong time.  This could cause issues with the safety and trust that has been placed in this system.

    <p>
      Nutritional facts could be fully removed from reality and considered a simulacrum using Baudrillard’s steps of removal.  Nutritional facts reflect basic reality by showing essential facts of food such as calories, fats, and proteins, that reflect the actual content of the food.  This helps people make informed choices when buying and consuming food.  They can mask their true meaning by emphasizing certain aspects of the food over others such as highlighting low-calorie and high protein while obscuring high sugar or fat.  This can distort someone's views on what they are consuming.  For the third step of absence, a nutritional label could be used to promote trending diets such as keto or paleo or overall health and wellness rather than just saying what the food contains.  Finally, nutritional facts could exist without any connection to food providing detailed information on something that doesn't exist. Or consumers may put healthy eating trends above actual content or enjoyment of food causing nutritional facts to be a representation of health rather than the food itself.
