    <p>A menu uses words and images to symbolize food and drinks, each item on the menu represents a different food or drink and what it contains.  This provides people a way to decide what they would like without having to try or see the food or drink.  It also lets people view the cost of each item before purchasing.  Menus often have categories to group similar items together like appetizers and entrees making it easier to navigate. They can help people make informed choices and find items within a set budget. A menu design can also help people understand what kind of establishment they are in, as a fine dining menu would differ from a deli menu design.  A menu representation is mostly accurate, sometimes a menu will have items on it that a restaurant does not have leading to misinformation.  However, a menu is still mostly successful in its representation of culinary offerings.</p>

    <p> A traffic light has three colors that all represent an action.  Red to stop, green to go, and yellow to slow down or prepare to stop. All of these colors are universally understood to mean these instructions even though they don’t have meanings on their own.  These instructions are recognized almost everywhere which helps with traffic safety and speed.  Ordering of the lights also helps people anticipate what comes next in the sequence.  Traffic lights can offer a complex set of instructions through a simple design.  They are very effective in their representations and don't often lead to misleading information.  I would say they are successful in the representation of traffic instructions.</p>

    <p>Nutritional facts show data on the nutrients contained in packaged food. This helps people gauge the nutritional value of prepackaged food and can compare it to other options.  They typically have a standardized format and include a serving size for reference.  This can help people make informed decisions about what they are eating.  They have to be compliant with food labeling regulations to make sure you know what you are consuming.  They visually use charts and include the recommended daily amount or percentage of each item.  Nutritional facts help translate complex dietary information into easily understandable information. They are very accurate to what they represent due to food laws and don’t contain misleading information making them very successful in their representations.</p>
